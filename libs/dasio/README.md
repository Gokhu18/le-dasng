Harvard Link Engineering Data Acquisition System I/O library

This library provides a framework for asynchronous interprocess
communication(IPC) and device I/O operating in an event loop.
This is intended as the core communications framework for a
new generation of data acquisition software based on the
Anderson Group Data Acquisition System architecture, allowing
for inter-operation between clients and servers running on
a heterogeneous network.
