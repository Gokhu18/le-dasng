/**
  tm_gen_client is a virtual base class for clients of tm_gen_dispatch. The main service provided is quit coordination.
  ready_to_quit() virtual function should return true if client is ready to quit. This will remove the client from the
  tm_gen_dispatch's list, so a subsequent detach() is unnecessary. Hence ready_to_quit() should set the dispatch member to
  NULL before returning a non-zero value.
  As a rule, clients should shut down all of their functions prior to returning. For devices, that means resmgr_detach()
  
  As written, this is probably a bad design, since tm_gen_dispatch::client_add is called with a partially constructed client.
  In a multi-threaded environment, there is a potential for harm.
