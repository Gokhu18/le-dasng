cmdgen package for generating command parsers for the
Link Engineering Data Acquisition System.

From a git checkout, you should be able to build via:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make


On QNX6, you will want to modify LDFLAGS as:

  LDFLAGS='=Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib'

This can be done in config.site, which is maintained in
QNX6/utils.
